Analysis is based on two datasets: descriptions of prjects (category, deadline, goal, etc.) and data on whether project raised necesarry funds or not. First of all, a short EDA is provided to understand which factors should be taken into account, then various hypotheses are put and checked by statistical methods. Finally, a dashboard on R is built which depicts main results of analysis.
